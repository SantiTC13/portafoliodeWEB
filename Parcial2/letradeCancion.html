    <p>Keep your hoes in check</p>
    
    <p>(Super)<br></p>

    <p>I got this girl and she wants me to duke her <br>
    I told her I'd come scoop her around eight, she said (super)<br>
    That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper<br>
    No matter what I need her to do, she be like (super)<br>
    Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa<br>
    On the microphone he flossed the ring (super)<br>
    Average emcees is like a TV blooper<br>
    MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper<br></p>

    <p>Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit<br>
    Just to cool her off she said niggas ain't about shit<br>
    I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it<br>
    The way it be in her mouth, she can't live without it<br>
    And can't live with this, handle your business<br>
    Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list<br>
    One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper<br>
    It's fun smackin rookies, he is the (super)<br></p>

    <p>Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow<br>
    Weirdo, brown skin'ded always kept his hair low<br>
    Rumors has it it's a S-curl accident<br>
    DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent<br>
    Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent<br>
    A lotta guys wonder where they stacks went<br>
    I call her thunder thighs, with the fatty swolla<br>
    Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her<br></p>

    <p>No matter the city, she with me to do the thang-thang<br>
    Work in the coochie, hooptie-chitty-chitty-bang-bang<br>
    Same name on the titty as on the name ring<br>
    Pretty like Baby D off all in the same gang<br></p>

    <p>Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her<br>
    But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut<br>
    And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa<br>
    Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the (super)<br>
    See most cats treat her like foofer<br>
    Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the (super)<br>
    You need to make her feel cuter<br>
    And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be (super)<br></p>

    <p>Do for her, keep her in a new fur<br>
    So she look sweet when she go to meet the (super)<br>
    Got the buddha, get the Grenadiers, twist it<br>
    Put it in the air, come here, kiss it<br>
    Listen here, scooter, let her try to bag you<br>
    When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu<br>
    Which will have you under some type of spell crying dag-boo<br>
    Her name on your back in a tattoo<br></p>

    <p>Whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick<br>
    Don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick<br>
    You don't want her, don't waste her time, I'll dupe her<br>
    And be a father to your child like the (super)<br></p>

    <p>He keep his hoes in check<br>
    Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks<br>
    Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real<br>
    Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal<br>
    Find out where he keep the Tek and the blue steel<br>
    Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel<br>
    And while he's runnin' down to all star weekend to ball<br>
    I'm coming with the U-Haul (super)<br></p>

    <p>(Super)<br></p>

    <p>(Super)<br></p>

    <p>Has the laser cannon been loaded?<br>
    Everything has been prepared as you ordered<br>
    But how did you get permission to return to New York, master?<br>
    Through the efforts of a misguided fool<br></p>

    <p>It's free enterprise<br>
    And I'm not gonna let some blasted government bureaucrat<br>
    Tell me how to run my business<br>
    But DOOM will be my guest on my private estate on Long Island<br>
    There's nothing you can do about it<br>
    He's dangerous, I just hope you know what you're doing<br>
    Don't I always?<br>
    Ah, there's DOOM's jet, right on time<br></p>

    <p>Why is it so cold down here?<br>
    The heat went out in the whole building<br>
    Warm enough out there on Long Island with DOOM<br>
    DOOM? Here in New York?<br>
    Yes, DOOM, has an amazing new machine<br></p>

    <p>Get the President of the United States on the phone<br>
    How long's all this gonna take, DOOM?<br>
    I would not advise you to repeat that error<br>
    Sure, I know what you mean<br>
